### Note
This is an old project that has been recently finished and patched. A big part of the code should be refactored and any help is welcomed. Pull requests will be reviewed and merged (if approved) as hastily as possible. 

## Concept

The aim of this game is to recreate the classic Pac-Man, as well as to provide a simple way to create new levels and illustrate basic encryption/decryption protocols and AI behavior.
